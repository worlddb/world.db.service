# world.db.service

world.db HTTP JSON API (web service) scripts

## Usage

You can run any of the scripts using the `worlddb` command line tool. By default the `serve` command will look for
a script named `Service` or `service.rb` (in the working folder, that is, `./`). Example:

```
$ worlddb serve
```

To run any other script - copy the script into the working folder and pass it along as an argument. Example:

```
$ worlddb serve starter      #  note: will (auto-)add the .rb extension  or
$ worlddb serve starter.rb
```
